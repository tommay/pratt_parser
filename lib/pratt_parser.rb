# A Pratt parser.  Similar to a recursive decent parser but instead of
# coding a function for each production, the syntax is coded in a set
# of token objects that are yielded by the lexer.  New operators and
# statements can be slipped in to the language with the proper
# precedence by adding new token objects to the lexer without altering
# the code for existing tokens.  Pretty cool.
#
# lexer is an enumerator with an each method that returns token objects
# with three methods:
# lbp: return the operator precedence.  Higher numbers bind more tightly.
# nud(parser): called when the token is the first token in an expression,
#   including a recursive call to expresssion (i.e., subexpression).  For
#   Example, this would be called for a unary operator, a literal, or for
#   the "if" in the construct "if <cond> then <expr>".
#   It is the token's responsibility to call parser.expression, parser.expect,
#   and/or parser.if? to handle the remainder of the expression, if any.
# led(parser, left): called when the token is preceeded by a subexpression,
#   left.  The token may be postfix or infix.
#   It is the token's responsibility to call parser.expression, parser.expect,
#   and/or parser.if? to handle the remainder of the expression, if any,
#   and combine it with left.
# Only lbp is mandatory.  nud and led will be called only when necessary, if
# ever.
# nud and lcd can call parser.expression(rbp) to recursively parse the
# right expression.  rbp should be the token's lbp for left-associativity,
# lbp-1 for right.
#
# PrattParser.new(lexer).eval will return the result of the parse.
#
# Syntax errors aren't handled at the moment and will cause ridiculous
# exceptions to be raised such as NoMethodError.
